    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <b>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</b>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <strong>It has survived not only five centuries</strong>, <i>but also the leap into electronic typesetting</i>, remaining essentially unchanged. <del>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages</del>, and <mark>more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</mark>.</p>
